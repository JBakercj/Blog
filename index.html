					<div class="contentheader">Who am I?</div>
					<div class="contentmessage">I'm a life-long Utahn and a first-time home owner in Lehi as of 2021. I graduated from UVU with a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice with an emphasis in law enforcement and a Master of Science in Cybersecurity. I am currently the At-Large member of the Utah Libertarian Party's Executive Committee, I have worked as a cybersecurity engineer, and I am currently a cybersecurity lead/architect. </div>

					<div class="contentheader">Why am I running?</div>
					<div class="contentmessage">As I have jumped into the world of politics, I realized that many problems originate from the government authority over-stepping into areas that the government should leave to individuals and the free market. With the renewed desire for freedom I see within the community, I believe it is time for a Libertarian to show what a champion of freedom would do in a legislative office. Reviewing the Cato Institute's Freedom in the 50 States report, Utah is 50th for gambling and alcohol freedom, worse than any Democratic state, and could be significantly better at reducing state spending and taxes. As a Libertarian, I would advocate freedom for all, as long as the lifestyle does not harm others, not just freedom for a specific lifestyle.</div>
